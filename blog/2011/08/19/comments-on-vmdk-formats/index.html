	<h2 class="title">Comments on VMDK Formats</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>To sum up part of the work in GSoC 2011, this post talks about some facts of
real-world VMDK format, which is not quite well documented in the official
Specification <a href="http://www.vmware.com/app/vmdk/?src=vmdk">Virtual Disk Format
1.1</a> (version may be changed from the
time this was written).</p>

<h2>Descriptor File Recognition Criteria</h2>

<p>In the specification it is not clearly defined what information is required for
image reader program to recognize the file as a VMDK image. The descriptor file
has no magic bytes as a text file, the first lines are consequently important
for recognizing. When you want to edit or generate from scratch a VMDK
descriptor file, don’t hesitate to follow the structure of the sample in the
specification, otherwise there are at least first two lines shouldn’t be moved
or mutated, because the first non-comment line “version=1″ is what makes a de
facto recognition criteria according to VMware Workstation. You can find the
detail in <a href="/blog/2011/06/15/more-about-vmdk-descriptor-file/">this</a> and
<a href="/blog/2011/05/23/vmdk-support-probing-mono-flat/">this</a> post.</p>

<h2>ESX Server Sparse Extent and VMDK3</h2>

<p>ESX Server Sparse Extent is a briefly specified format in the specificaion. It
is said to be a sparse extent type used in ESX servers, but it is definitely
not appearing in recent ESX applications. On the other hand the format is very
close to the obsolete VMDK3 sparse extent (somehow indistinguishable).</p>

<p>To be short, ESX Server Sparse Extent is (no longer) a real world VMDK format
type, it might be an alias of old VMDK3 (which is only used before VMware
workstation 4.0 and no longer supported in VMware Workstation 5 and newer
versions), and it is not seen anywhere else except the specification. However
there are difference between VMDK3 and ESX Server Sparse Extent, it’s discussed
in details <a href="/blog/2011/07/03/differences-between-vmdk3-and-the-specification/">here</a></p>

<h2>About createTypes</h2>

<p>There are a dozen of VMDK create types according to the specification, but only
half of them are commonly used. MonolithicSparse, monolithicFlat,
twoGbMaxExtentSparse and twoGbMaxExtentFlat are four brothers that are produced
according to two option flags: “split into 2GB files” and “allocate all space
on creating”. Besides these, vmfs is widely used in ESX servers, whose format
detail is not open so we don’t have much to dig in. StreamOptimized is a format
for exporting ESX server VM’s, this will be discuzed later.</p>

<h2>Header field: overHead</h2>

<p>OverHead is a field in SparseExtentHeader, it’s explaination as “overHead is
the number of sectors occupied by the metadata”. Here the word “metadata” means
everything other than data grains, including header and grain directory/tables,
which are all allocated once the image is created. As a result, overHead is
also the offset of the first data grain. This is an implication and should be
taken care of.</p>

<h2>About compress and streamOptimized</h2>

<p>Compression is an optional feature in sparse extents, the compressing algorithm
is RFC 1951 (Deflate). Data is only compressed in streamOptimized images, which
also has grainMarker feature enable. Compression is not used alone, if we
create a monolithicSparse with header.compressAlgorithm set and write some
compressed data, VMware won’t read the correct data, it simply read the
compressed bytes out.</p>

<p>StreamOptimized is used mainly for the purpose of transferring, although it can
be attached to VM in VMware Workstation and read data normally, writing is
limited to the unallocated offsets, any overwriting to existing disk sectors
are silently discarded. This would easily lead to inconsistence, so I think the
only reasonable use case of streamOptimized is to export some local image to
this type for upload and download, once the transmission is over, it should be
converted back to host disk types (such as monolithicSparse or similar), before
booting the guest system.</p>

<h2>Special Images</h2>

<p>There are image cases not strictly following the specification, but found to
working with VMware. One of those is Haiku VMDK image (VM mirrors at
http://haiku-os.org/get-haiku). It is composed of Host Sparse Extent Header +
Descriptor file + Flat data. Where header fields capacity, gdOffset and
rgdOffset are zero, and the following descriptor specifies the extent to be
FLAT pointing to the file itself with offset 128 and the data start from offset
0×10000.  Using sparse header with flat data is uncommon, and obviously beyond
definition of the specification. However both VMware and VirtualBox support
such case. Furthermore, as it is tested, the vmdk file name must be the same
with the one in descriptor for VMware to be correctly attached, just like how
descriptor file + separate flat extent work.  There was also a QEMU bug report
with <a href="/blog/2011/07/21/bug-track-issue-with-block-vmdk/">this</a>.</p>

<h2>vmware-mount</h2>

<p>VMware VDDK contains a tool ‘vmware-mount’ that is capable of mounting a
partition in VMDK disk on the host file system. It uses FUSE to achieve this.
The internal is introduced <a href="/blog/2011/06/15/testing-vmware-mount/">here</a>.</p>
