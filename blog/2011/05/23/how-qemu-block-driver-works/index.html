	<div class="entry-content"><h1>Preface</h1>

<p>Today is the first day of GSoC 2011. I’m starting working on improving VMDK
support of QEMU block driver. The most important thing before I can code is to
understand well how QEMU block driver works. So here a very basic description
of QEMU block driver code structure is given.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>In the source tree dir ‘block/’ there are quite a few files, each is a block
driver and is used to access a particular type of device, format or protocol.
E.g. raw-{posix, win32}.c are drivers for local files. All these drivers are
self-registered and runtime instanced by block.c. Before going to the driver
internals, let’s have a look at how block.c uses the drivers.</p>

<h1>Example</h1>

<p>Let’s go with a very simple example, assuming that there is an QED image:
/media/F/VM/test.qed, and we run qemu-img info /media/F/VM/test.qed to query
the info. The program successfully get what we want:</p>

<p>image: /media/F/VM/test.qed file format: qed virtual size: 32G (34359738368
bytes) disk size: 2.3G cluster_size: 65536</p>

<h1>Explanation</h1>

<p>So what happened during the program progress? At first qemu-img.c only gets
a pathname string “/media/F/VM/test.qed“, and it calls ‘block.c:
bdrv_open()‘ with it, everything is done there. In block.c, a protocol is
found for the actual IO of image file. As it is a common disk file, the
basic protocal “file” is used, which is a driver implemented in
block/raw-{posix, win32}.c. Using the protocal driver, metadata or magic
number is read to probe for the possible driver in a traverse through all
drivers. As long as a proper driver is found, it is instanced to handle the
image file and become responsible to retrieve any concrete information
(that we saw from qemu-img output).</p>

<p>Each driver instance contains a set of operations (function pointers) and
two kinds of data holding the instance state, the common data and the
driver specific data. The operation and common data structures are defined
in block_int.h, they are struct BlockDriver and struct BlockDriverState.
The driver specific data structures are defined in each driver
implementation .c files in block/. For example struct BDRVVmdkState in
block/vmdk.c. The BlockDriverState structure is the main struct for a
driver instance, inside which there are pointers to BlockDriver (.drv) and
specific state data (.opaque). So every time a driver instance is accessed,
a BlockDriverState structure pointer is passed.</p>

<p>Having BlockDriverState in hand, it becomes easy to figure out how block
driver works, calling functions in BlockDriver can make vmdk driver to
perform various work (probe, open or rw the image, or even creating an
initial image file), where driver further access the protocol driver for
IO. The protocol driver instance is save in .file field, which is also a
BlockDriverState. We can see here the driver is cascaded, this is also the
case for backing file support, which in theory make it possible that one
kind of image format use another format as its backing file.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>QEMU block driver is designed very modular, in order to improve some format
support, the needed modification can be very local. The overall process of
block device handling is hidden from the driver implementation, as a result
device drivers are considerably maintainable.</p>
